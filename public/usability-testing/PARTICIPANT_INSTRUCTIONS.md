# Pastree Extension - Participant Instructions

## Welcome to the Pastree Usability Test!

Thank you for volunteering to help us test Pastree, a new clipboard manager browser extension. Your honest feedback is invaluable in making this product better before we launch it to the public.

## What is Pastree?

Pastree is a **clipboard manager extension** for your web browser. 

**What's a clipboard manager?**  
When you copy text (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C), it goes to your clipboard. Normally, you can only paste the most recent thing you copied. A clipboard manager keeps a history of everything you copy, allowing you to access and reuse any previously copied content.

**Why is this useful?**
- No more losing copied text when you copy something else
- Access your clipboard history anytime
- Organize frequently-used snippets into lists
- Search through your clipboard history
- Quick access via keyboard shortcuts

## Important: Think-Aloud Protocol

### What is Think-Aloud?

As you complete each task, we need you to **speak your thoughts out loud**. This helps us understand:
- What you're trying to accomplish
- What you expect to happen
- What you're looking for
- Any confusion or frustration you experience
- Your reactions to what you see

### Think-Aloud Examples

**Good Example**:
> "I'm looking for a way to view my clipboard history... I see this icon in my toolbar, so I'll click on it... Oh! It opened a popup showing all the things I've copied. That's helpful! Now I'm looking for the text I copied a moment ago... I see it here at the top of the list..."

**Another Good Example**:
> "Hmm, I want to create a list but I'm not sure where to do that... I don't see an obvious button... Let me try this '+' icon... Oh, that's for something else... Maybe in settings?"

**Not Helpful**:
> *[Silent working, no verbal feedback]*

### Tips for Thinking Aloud

- **Narrate your actions**: "I'm clicking on...", "I'm looking for...", "I'm trying to..."
- **Express expectations**: "I expect this will...", "I think clicking here will..."
- **Voice confusion**: "I'm not sure what this does...", "I expected to see..."
- **Share reactions**: "Oh, that's cool!", "This is confusing...", "I like this..."
- **Be honest**: There are no wrong answers - confusion is valuable feedback!

### Don't Worry About:

- Sounding silly - we want your raw, honest thoughts
- Being too critical - negative feedback helps us improve
- Taking too long - work at your natural pace
- Getting stuck - that tells us where the product needs improvement
